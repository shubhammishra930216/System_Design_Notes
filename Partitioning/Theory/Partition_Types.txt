->One of the Most importent needs in a distributed system is "Scalbility" of the system and one of the ways to achives the same is "PARTITIONING"

#PARTITIONING -> It is the process of splitting the dataset into smaller datasets and assiging these smaller datasets to different nodes for their management and processing . 

There are primarily 2 types of partitioning :

1. Vertical - In this process , we split the dataset into smaller dataset with fewer columns and with additional tables storing the column which defines relationship across rows in the tables . Its a logical partitioning of data and mostly done by developer itself . 

     Limitations: To generate the response ,as different tables are joined ,it may increase the overall latency of the system . 


2.Horizontal [Sharring] -> This process is also known as sharding ,in this process we split the dataset into smaller dataset with each dataset containing a small percentage of the total rows of the original dataset . This is a physical partitioning . 
      
      Limitations: 1. As the rows are distributed across multiple nodes , we loose the atomiicty of operations 
      2.There might be multiple nodes scan if the range of requested response is large which may increase latency
